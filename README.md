# RobustBetareg

This repository contains the R codes and the datasets used in the application section of the paper "Robust beta regression through the logit transformation" by Yuri S. Maluf, Silvia L. P. Ferrari, Francisco F. Queiroz (2022), as well as the scripts for reproducing the simulation results.

The main functions are adapted from those developed by Terezinha K. A. Ribeiro and available at \url{https://github.com/terezinharibeiro/RobustBetaRegression}.
